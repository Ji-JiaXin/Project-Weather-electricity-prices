# Project-Weather-electricity-prices
Welcome to our Python project for “Data Processing in Python” (JEM207) aimed at exploring the relationship between weather conditions, especially air temperature, and electricity consumption and generation in Germany. Given that Germany's energy mix is predominantly comprised of renewables, weather should be a significant factor influencing electricity suplly and demand. We prepared a module that allows users to input temperatures from previous days and potencialy the forecast for upcomming days. The module will analyze historical weather data and identify timeperiods when weather conditions closely resemble the provided input. The user can also set the threshold setting the allowance for consideration of past time periods as similar, in the matter of weather situation.

The ultimate goal is to provide the user with information regarding the development of the monitored indicator during the past periods with similar weather conditions. 

Join us on this exciting journey, and let us explore together the impact of weather on electricity flow within the German energy system!
